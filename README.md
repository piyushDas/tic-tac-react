This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`
Please install all the dependecies when you clone the project first time

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `node server.js`
In a separate tab in your terminal/cmd start the backend.
The server.js file is located in the project root directory


For checking the app for mobile, rather than decreasing the screen size,
please prefer opening the responsive mode (with any selected mobile device) - please reload the page

The page is responsive, but loads mobile app on the basis of useragent not just device size.

The pagination is done from server side
